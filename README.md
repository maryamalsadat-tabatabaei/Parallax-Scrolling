## Technologies Used

This project is based on the work of [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga/mern-course-jobify), and I would like to acknowledge their contributions. I have made modifications and added new features to extend the functionality of the original project and I built upon that foundation to extend the project's functionality and address specific requirements. However, the core concept and initial implementation were inspired by the course and the work of the original author.

**New Features**

**React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.

**Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process with pre-defined classes. Tailwind CSS's classes enable rapid styling and ensure consistency throughout the website's design.

**React Router**: Facilitates seamless navigation between different sections of the website, enhancing user experience.

**CSS**: Used in conjunction with Tailwind CSS for custom styling.

**HTML**: Provides the structural foundation of the webpage.
